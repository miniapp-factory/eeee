#### Create a farcaster mini app that allows someone to find out which disney princess they are most similar to by answering 5 multiple choice questions and be able to share this on their feed. Generate an image for each princess.  

I need to modify the home page (`mini-app/app/page.tsx`) to add the quiz and share functionality.  
Could you please add that file to the chat so I can edit it?
